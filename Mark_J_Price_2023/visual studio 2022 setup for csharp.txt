Open visual stuido 2022 , On the Workloads tab, select the following:

    •   ASP.NET and web development.
    
    •   .NET desktop development (because this includes console apps).
    
    •   Desktop development with C++ with all default components 
        (because this enables publishing console apps and web services that start faster 
        and have smaller memory footprints).
    
    •   The first time that you run Visual Studio, you will be prompted to configure your environment.
        For "Development Settings", choose "Visual C#". 
        For the color theme, I chose Blue, but you can choose whatever tickles your fancy.
    
    •   If you want to customize your keyboard shortcuts, 
        navigate to Tools | Options…, and then select the Keyboard section.
