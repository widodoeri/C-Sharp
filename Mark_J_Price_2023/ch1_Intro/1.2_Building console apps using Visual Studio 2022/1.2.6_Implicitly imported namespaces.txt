The  " using System; "  statement at the top of the file imports the "System" namespace. 

This enables the " Console.WriteLine " statement to work. 

Why do we not have to import it in our project?

The trick is that we do still need to import the "System" namespace, 
but it is now done for us using a combination of features introduced in C# 14 and .NET 10. 

Let’s see how:

1.  In "Solution Explorer", expand the "obj" folder, expand the "Debug" folder, 
    expand the "net10.0 folder", 
    and open the file named "your_project_name.GlobalUsings.g.cs"


2.  Note that this file is automatically created by the compiler for projects 
    that target .NET 6 or later, 
    and that it uses a feature introduced in C# 10 called "global namespace imports", 
    which imports some commonly used namespaces like System for use in all code files, 
    as shown in the following code:

    // <auto-generated/>
    global using System;
    global using System.Collections.Generic;
    global using System.IO;
    global using System.Linq;
    global using System.Net.Http;
    global using System.Threading;
    global using System.Threading.Tasks;


3.  In "Solution Explorer", click the "Show All Files" (3 paper icon) button 
    to hide the "bin" and "obj" folders.
