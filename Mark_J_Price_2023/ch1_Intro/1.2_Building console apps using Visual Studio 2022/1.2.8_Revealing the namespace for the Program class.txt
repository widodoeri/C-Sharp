Now, let’s discover what namespace the "Program" class has been defined within:


1.  In "Program.cs", before the statement that throws an exception, 
    add statements to get the name of the namespace of the "Program" class, 
    and then write it to the console, 
    
    as shown in the following code:


        string name = typeof(Program).Namespace ?? "None!";
        Console.WriteLine($"Namespace: {name}");


        " ?? " is the "null-coalescing operator". 
        The first statement means, "If the namespace of Program is null, then return None!; 
        otherwise, return the name."



2.  In Visual Studio, navigate to "Debug | Start Without Debugging".

3.  The output in the console window will show the result of running your application, 
    including that the hidden Program class was defined without a namespace, 
    as shown in the following output:


        Namespace: None!


4.  Press any key to close the console app window and return to Visual Studio.
