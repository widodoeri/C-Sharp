Two compiler-generated folders were created, named "obj" and "bin":


•   The "obj" folder contains one compiled "object" file for each source code file. 
    These objects haven’t been linked together into a final executable yet.


•   The "bin" folder contains the "binary" executable for the application or class library. 


You do not need to look inside these folders or understand their files yet.

Just be aware that the compiler needs to create temporary folders and files to do its work. 
You could delete these folders and their files, and they will be automatically recreated 
the next time you “build” or run the project. 

Developers often delete these temporary folders and files to “clean” a project. 

Visual Studio even has a command on the "Build" menu named "Clean Solution" 
that deletes some of these temporary files for you.

The equivalent command with Visual Studio Code is "dotnet clean".
