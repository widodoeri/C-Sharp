Key points to remember about top-level programs include the following:

    •   There can be only one file like this in a project.

    •   Any using statements must be at the top of the file.
    
    •   If you declare any classes or other types, they must be at the bottom of the file.
    
    •   Although you should name the method "Main" if you explicitly define it, 
        the method is named  <Main>$  when created by the compiler.
