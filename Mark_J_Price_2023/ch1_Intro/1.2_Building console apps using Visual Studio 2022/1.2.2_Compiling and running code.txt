1.  navigate top menu "Debug | Start Without Debugging".

    Good Practice:
    
        When you start a project in Visual Studio 2022, you can choose whether to attach a debugger or not. 
        If you do not need to debug, then it is better not to attach one because attaching a debugger 
        requires more resources and slows everything down. 
        
        Attaching a debugger also limits you to only starting one project. 
        If you want to run more than one project, each with a debugger attached,
        then you must start multiple instances of Visual Studio. 
        
        In the toolbar, click the "green outline triangle" button, to start without debugging.
        if you need to debuging, use "green solid triangle" button.



2.  In the "Solution Explorer" toolbar, toggle on the "Show All Files" button (3 paper icon).

    you will see compiler-generated "bin" and "obj" folders are visible.
