If you have seen older .NET projects before, then you might have expected more code, 
even just to output a simple message. 

This project has minimal statements because some of the required code is written for you 
by the compiler when you target .NET 6 or later.

If you had created the project with .NET SDK 5 or earlier, 
or if you had selected the check box labeled Do not use top-level statements, 
then the "Program.cs" file would have more statements, as shown in the following code:


    using System;

    namespace first_project
    {
        internal class Program
        {
            static void Main(string[] args)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
            }
        }
    }



During compilation with .NET SDK 6 or later, all the boilerplate code to define the "Program" class 
and its "Main" method is generated and wrapped around the statements you write.

This uses a feature introduced in .NET 5 called "top-level programs", 
but it was not until .NET 6 that Microsoft updated the project template for console apps 
to use top-level statements by default. 

Then in .NET 7 or later, Microsoft added options to use the older style if you prefer:


•   If you are using Visual Studio 2022, select the Check box labeled "Do not use top-level statements".

•   If you are using the dotnet CLI at the command prompt, add a switch:

        dotnet new console --use-program-main
