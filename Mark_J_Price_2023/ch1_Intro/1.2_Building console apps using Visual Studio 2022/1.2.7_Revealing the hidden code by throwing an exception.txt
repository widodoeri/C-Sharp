Now let’s discover how the hidden code has been written:

1.  In "Program.cs", after the statement that outputs the message, 
    add a statement to throw a new exception, as shown in the following code:


        throw new Exception();


2.  In Visual Studio, navigate to "Debug | Start Without Debugging". 
    (Do not start the project with debugging or the exception will be caught by the debugger!)


3.  The output in the console window will show the result of running your application, 
    including that a hidden "Program" class was defined by the compiler 
    with a method named " <Main>$ " that has a parameter named args for passing in arguments.

4.  Press any key to close the console app window and return to Visual Studio.
