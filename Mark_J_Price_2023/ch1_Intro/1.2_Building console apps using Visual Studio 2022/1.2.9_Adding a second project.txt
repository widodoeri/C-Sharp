Let’s add a second project to our solution to explore how to work with multiple projects:


1.  In Visual Studio, navigate to "File | Add | New Project…"

    Warning!!!
        The above step adds a new project to the existing solution. 
        Do NOT navigate to "File | New | Project…", 
        which instead is meant to be used to create a new project and solution 
        (although the dialog box has a dropdown to choose to add to an existing solution too).


2.  In the "Add a new project" dialog, in "Recent project templates", 
    select "Console App [C#]" and then click Next.


3.  In the "Configure your new project" dialog, for "Project name", enter "AboutMyEnvironment", 
    the location is the same with existing project, and then click Next.


4.  In the "Additional information" dialog, select ".NET 10.0 (Long Term Support)" 
    and select the "Do not use top-level statements" check box.

        Warning!!! 
        
        Make sure you have selected the "Do not use top-level statements" check box, 
        so we get to see the older style of "Program.cs".

    
    Click Create


5.  In the "AboutMyEnvironment" project, in "Program.cs", 
    note the statements to define a namespace that matches the project name, 
    an internal class named "Program", and a static method named "Main" with a parameter named "args"
    that returns nothing (void), as shown in the following code:


        namespace AboutMyEnvironment
        {
        internal class Program
        {
            static void Main(string[] args)
            {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
            }
        }
        }


6.  In "Program.cs", in the "Main" method, replace the existing "Console.WriteLine" statement 
    with statements to output the current directory, the version of the operating system, 
    and the namespace of the "Program" class, as shown in the following code:


        Console.WriteLine(Environment.CurrentDirectory);
        Console.WriteLine(Environment.OSVersion.VersionString);
        Console.WriteLine("Namespace: {0}", typeof(Program).Namespace);


7.  In "Solution Explorer", right-click the top folder "Solution 'first_project'(2 of 2 projects)", 
    and then select "Set a Startup Projects…"


8.  In the "Solution your_first_project Property" Pages dialog box, 
    set "Startup Project" to "Current selection", and then click OK.


9.  In "Solution Explorer", click the "AboutMyEnvironment" project (or any file or folder within it),
    and note that Visual Studio indicates that "AboutMyEnvironment" is now the startup project 
    by making the project name bold.



    Good Practice !!!: 
    
    we recommend this way of setting the startup project because it then makes it very easy 
    to switch startup projects by simply clicking a project (or any file in a project) 
    to make it the startup project. 
    
    Although you can right-click a project and set it as a startup project, 
    if you then want to run a different project, you must manually change it again. 
    Simply clicking anywhere in the project is easier. 


10. Navigate to "Debug | Start Without Debugging" to run the "AboutMyEnvironment" project, 
    and note the result, as shown in the following output:

        picture 1.2.9_


11. Press any key to close the console app window and return to Visual Studio.


        When using Visual Studio 2022 for Windows to run a console app, 
        it executes the app from the "<projectname>\bin\Debug\net10.0" folder. 
        
        It will be important to remember this when we work with the filesystem in later. 
        When using Visual Studio Code, or more accurately, the dotnet CLI,
        it has different behavior.
