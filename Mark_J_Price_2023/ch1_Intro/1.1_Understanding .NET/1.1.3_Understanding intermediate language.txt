The C# compiler (named Roslyn) used by the dotnet CLI tool converts your C# source code 
into "intermediate language (IL)" code and stores the IL in an assembly (a DLL or EXE file).


IL code statements are like assembly language instructions, which are executed by .NET’s virtual machine,
known as "CoreCLR".


At runtime, CoreCLR loads the IL code from the assembly, 
the "just-in-time (JIT)" compiler compiles it into native CPU instructions, 
and then it is executed by the CPU on your machine.


The benefit of this two-step compilation process is that Microsoft can create 
"Common language runtimes (CLRs)" for Linux and macOS, as well as for Windows. 

The same IL code runs everywhere because of the second compilation step, 
which generates code for the native operating system and CPU instruction set.

Regardless of which language the source code is written in, for example, C#, Visual Basic, or F#, 
all .NET applications use IL code for their instructions stored in an assembly. 

Microsoft and others provide disassembler tools that can open an assembly and reveal this IL code, 
such as the ILSpy .NET Decompiler extension.
