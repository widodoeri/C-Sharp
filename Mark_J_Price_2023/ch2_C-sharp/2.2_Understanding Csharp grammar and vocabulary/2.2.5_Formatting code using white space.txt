White space includes the space, tab, and newline characters. 

You can use white space to format your code however you like because extra white space 
has no effect on the compiler.

The following four statements are all equivalent:

    
        int sum = 1 + 2; // Most developers would prefer this format.

    
        int
        sum=1+
        2; // One statement over three lines.


        int       sum=    1    +2;int sum=1+2; // Two statements on one line.


The only white space character required in the preceding statements is one between int and sum 
to tell the compiler they are separate tokens. 
Any single white space character, for example a space, tab, or newline would be acceptable.
