The C# vocabulary is made up of "keywords", "symbol characters", and "types".

Some of the predefined, reserved keywords that you will see frequently include :

    
    using, namespace, class, static, int, string, double, bool, if, switch, break, 
    while, do, for, foreach, this, and true.


Some of the symbol characters that you will see include :

    
    ", ', +, -, *, /, %, @, and $.


There are other contextual keywords that only have a special meaning in a specific context:

    
    and, or, not, record, and init
    

However, that still means that there are only about 100 actual C# keywords in the language.
