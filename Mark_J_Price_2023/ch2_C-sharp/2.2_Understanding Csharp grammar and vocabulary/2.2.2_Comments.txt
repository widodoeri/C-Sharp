single comment use      : //

multiple comment use    : /* */

Although /* */ is mostly used for multiline comments, 
it is also useful for commenting in the middle of a statement, as shown in the following code:

    
    decimal totalPrice = subtotal /* for this item */ + salesTax;



Visual Studio has commands to make it easier to add and remove comment characters :

-   Navigate to Edit | Advanced | Comment Selection or Uncomment Selection

-   or use shortcut :   CTRL + K + C to comment 
                        CTRL + K + U to uncomment
