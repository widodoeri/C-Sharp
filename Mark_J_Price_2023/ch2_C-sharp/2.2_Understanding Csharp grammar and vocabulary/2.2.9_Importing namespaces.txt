"System" is a namespace, which is like an address for a type. 

To refer to someone’s location exactly, you 
might use Oxford.HighStreet.BobSmith, which tells us to look for a person named Bob Smith on the
High Street in the city of Oxford.
System.Console.WriteLine tells the compiler to look for a method named WriteLine in a type named 
Console in a namespace named System.
