C# indicates the end of a "statement" with a semicolon (;). 

A statement can be composed of multiple "types", "variables", and "expressions"
made up of "tokens". 

Each token is separated by white space or some other recognizably different token, 
like an operator, for example, = or +. 

For example, in the following statement, "decimal" is a type, "totalPrice" is a variable, 
and "subtotal + salesTax" is an expression:


    decimal totalPrice = subtotal + salesTax;


The expression is made up of an operand named "subtotal", an operator "+", 
and another operand named "salesTax". 

The order of operands and operators matters because the order affects the meaning and result.
