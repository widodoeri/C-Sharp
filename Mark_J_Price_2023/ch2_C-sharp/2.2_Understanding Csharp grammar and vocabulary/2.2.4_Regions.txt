You can define your own labeled regions around any statements you want 
and then most code editors will allow you to collapse and expand them 
in the same way as blocks, as shown in the following code:


    #region Three variables that store the number 2 million.
    
    int decimalNotation = 2_000_000;
    int binaryNotation = 0b_0001_1110_1000_0100_1000_0000;
    int hexadecimalNotation = 0x_001E_8480;
    
    #endregion


In this way, regions can be treated as commented blocks that can be collapsed 
to show a summary of what the block does.
